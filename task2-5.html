            <p>This page looks much clearer now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
            <p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id,"content".<br>This allows us to differentiates it from others divs and give it a white background.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>This is a normal paragraph, <span class="blue">except this span of text is blue</span> and <span class="fancy">this span has a font-family of cursive,</span><br>because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
            <p><span class="blue fancy">On the other hand, this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span></p>
        </div>

        <p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
